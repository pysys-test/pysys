    <title>Runner - independent namespaces for run.py files</title>    
    <purpose><![CDATA[
Checks that symbols defined or imported in one run.py don't affect others, 
since any such interference would result in horrendous bugs and race condition 
when tests are executed in parallel, or tests that only work when another 
test has executed before them but not on their own. 
And helper classes written for one test could be used by another test 
if they happened to have the same name.
