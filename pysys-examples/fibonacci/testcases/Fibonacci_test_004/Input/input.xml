OK - if you are going to do this manually you need to go off and get a calculator.

    <description><![CDATA[
Using your calculator you should work out the first 10 entries of the series, where starting with 0 and 1 (the first and second entries), each new number in the series is simply the sum of the two before it. Hence perform the following;

Entry 0 = 0
Entry 1 = 1
Entry 2 = (0+1) = 1
Entry 3 = (1+1) = 2
Entry 4 = (1+2) = 3
.

Continue performing this until you calculate the tenth entry, and confirm that the entry = 34.
