	Set the test writers to write the test summary at runtime when the -r option is 
	passed to the run mode of the pysys launcher. Multiple test writers can be configured
	and properties can be set on the writers using a nested property tag; these are then set 
	as attributes of the class. PySys ships the XMLResultsWriter and TextResultsWriter as two 
	example writers, though custom writers can be created e.g. to output directly in HTML, 
	insert into a relational database etc (see pysys.writers.__init__.py for the source code 
	for the distributed writers). If no writer is specified in the project file, the 
	XMLResultsWriter is used. 
	
	The writer tag details the classname (which should be added to the pythonpath using the 
	path tag), the module of the writer class, and the filename template to use for the logging. 
	The filename template is processed through time.strftime so that time information can be set 
	into the filename, e.g. a filename template of 'testsummary-%Y%m%d%H%M%S.xml' will result in 
	a file created with a name of  testsummary-20081025213308.xml etc.
