    <title>Process Module - start process in background</title>    
    <purpose><![CDATA[
Tests for the successfull execution of a process in the background. The startProcess method should not block 
in this case, allowing concurrent execution within the testcase. The running() method on the process handle is 
used to query the running status of the process, and the waitProcess method is used to wait for completion of 
the process until the process has completed execution.
