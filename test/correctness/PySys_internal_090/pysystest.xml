    <title>Writers - escaping of XML control characters in stdout and outcome reason</title>    
    <purpose><![CDATA[
Checks that we don't generate illegal/unparseable XML - since delightfully XML 
outlaws lots of valid utf-8 characters, and Python's XML generation libraries 
do not have a way of coping with this: https://bugs.python.org/issue5166. 

Also checks we strip out the ascii control characters from outcome reason 
(for all output mechanisms not just XML) since they're not helpful.
