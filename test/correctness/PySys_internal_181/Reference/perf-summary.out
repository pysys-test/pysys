Performance comparison summary between the following runs (the differing "run details" are shown):
- 2022-02-05_14.08.51.win (4 results, 1 samples/result):
     outDirName=historicOutDir, hostname=orighost, startTime=2022-02-05 14:08:51 .. 2022-02-07 16:00:00
- myoutdir (3 results, 1 samples/result):
     outDirName=historicOutDir, hostname=myjsonhost, startTime=2022-02-05 18:38:03
- this (2 results, 3 samples/result):
     outDirName=myoutdir, <stripped>

Comparison results:
  where format is (fromRun->toRun): (%improvement) = (change above 2 sigmas/stdDevs is 95% probability it's significant)

Rate of doing a badda-badda-bing from MyNestedTestcase
 Mean from this run = 2,003 /s, stdDev=1 (0.0% of mean)
  2022-02-05_14.08.51.win->this: +33.5% = +4.1 sigmas
                 myoutdir->this:  -1.8% = -36.3 sigmas
