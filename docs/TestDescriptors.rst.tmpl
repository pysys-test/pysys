Test Descriptors
================

Each PySys test has a descriptor containing metadata about the test such as its title, the modes it can run in, 
and the test groups it is part of. This information is all stored in a 
`TestDescriptor <pysys.config.descriptor.TestDescriptor>` instance, which can be accessed within each test using 
``self.descriptor``. 

Sample pysystest.xml
--------------------

The following sample illustrates all the possible configuration options for a test's ``pysystest.xml`` file. 

This is intended as a reference, and to provide somewhere to copy snippets from as needed. Do not copy the whole thing 
into your own tests as this example contains many fields that are only used for advanced cases. Instead use 
``pysys make`` to create new tests, including a ``pysystest.xml`` that contains everything you need for most tests. 

.. code-block:: xml
@PYSYSTESTXML@

See the "cookbook" PySys sample that this XML file comes from to see how these work in practice. 

Sample pysysdirconfig.xml
-------------------------

You can provide descriptor defaults for an entire subdirectory of tests by adding a ``pysysdirconfig.xml`` file, 
which avoids the need to copy mode/group/id-prefix information into each individual test, reduces the chance of 
mistakes, and makes it easier to add new modes and other setting later as your project evolves. 

Most of the directory-level options are the same as ``pysystest.xml`` but there are a few options that don't make 
sense at the directory level, and also additional options for directories such as ``id-prefix``. 

.. code-block:: xml
@PYSYSDIRCONFIGXML@
