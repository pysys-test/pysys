PySys 0.1.6 Release Notes
=========================

This is an early ALPHA release of the software for development purposes. 
The software is liable to change in a non-backwards compatible way until 
it has reached a BETA status.


What is new in this release
---------------------------
- Added the ability to differentiate between automated and manual testcases 
  using the test attribute to the pysystest element in the testcase 
  descriptor. If the attribute is not present the test will be assumed to 
  be an automated test. The runTest and printTest launch helpers allow you 
  to different between automated and manaul tests using the --type command 
  line argument. For more information see the examples in pysys-examples
