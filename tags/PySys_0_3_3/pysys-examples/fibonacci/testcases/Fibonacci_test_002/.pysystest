    <title>Python to calculate the fibonacci series - validates on text output</title>
    <purpose><![CDATA[
In this example testcase, the first ten values of the fibonacci series are calculated 
in memory and written to text file in the test output subdirectory. The validate method 
perform multiple validations on the contents of the output file, to 

  a) diff against a reference
  b) perform greps for regular expressions in the output
  c) perform an ordered grep for a sequence of regular expressions in the output 
  d) perform a line count of the number of lines matching a regular expression
