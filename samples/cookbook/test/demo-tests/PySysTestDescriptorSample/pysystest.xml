	<!-- Test titles should be concise but give a clear idea of what is in scope for this testcase. 

	Good titles make it easy to find the test you need even when you have 100s/1000s of tests. 
	Tests can be sorted by title so try to use common prefixes (e.g. ``Category: Title``) to group related tests 
	together, and run ``pysys print -s=title`` to see how your title looks alongside the existing titles. 
	
	Titles need to be human readable at-a-glance, so don't put ids (e.g. bug tracking numbers) in the title; 
	the "purpose" or "requirements" are a better place for those details. 
	
	The title can also be specified without XML as: __pysystest_title__ = """ ... """ 
	-->
	<title>My foobar tool: Argument parsing success and error cases</title>

	<!-- Specify the groups that this test will be tagged with, allowing them to be selected 
	for inclusion/exclusion in test runs. Groups are usually named in camelCase. 
	These groups are in addition to any from parent pysysdirconfigs if inherit=true.

	<!-- Specify modes supported by this test. Like test ids, mode names are usually TitleCase.
	
	Optional attributes are:
		 inherit=  Specifies whether modes from parent pysysdirconfig.xml files are automatically added to this list. 
				For clarity this attribute should usually be specified, but if not the default is inherit=true unless 
				there are multiple modes elements in which case it is false. 
		 primary=  Specifies which mode from this list (including any inherited modes) is the primary one that executes 
				by default, and before any other modes. If not specified, the first mode is the primary one. 
		 exclude=  Specifies a Python eval string using "mode" (or "mode.params") which can return True for any modes 
				that should be dynamically removed/ignored from this list, or else False. This is useful for selectively 
				excluding some inherited modes, or for excluding modes on certain platforms. Note that no test descriptor 
				is generated for excluded modes, so there will be no result reported (not even SKIPPED) for excluded modes. 
				
				This string is evaluated from a Python namespace that includes standard modules such as os/sys/math/re, 
				as well as the 'pysys' module and the contents of the `pysys.constants` module, e.g. ``IS_WINDOWS``; 
				(see pysys.utils.safeeval.safeEval for more details).
