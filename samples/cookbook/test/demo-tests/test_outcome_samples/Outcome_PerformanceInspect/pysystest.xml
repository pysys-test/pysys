		<title>Demo of outcomes: INSPECT .svg charts from performance testing</title>		
		<purpose><![CDATA[
		Demonstrates how the INSPECT outcome prevents output files being purged (even with the --purge flag), 
		and how extra test artifacts can be collected based on filename using a writer (nb: this doesn't require 
		an INSPECT outcome, and in fact is often used instead of INSPECT), and how performance results can be logged.
