"""
Contains cross platform classes and utilities for starting, stopping and monitoring processes. 

The module contains the base class L{pysys.process.user} that can be extended by subclasses that 
require the ability to start, stop, interact and monitor processes started by the PySys 
framework. Subclasses within the framework are the L{pysys.basetest.BaseTest} and 
L{pysys.baserunner.BaseRunner} classes, both of which may be required to start processes as part 
of the execution of a set of testcases. The import path of the helper and monitor modules is set up
at runtime so as to select either the Win32 modules (located in pysys.process.plat-win32), or the 
unix modules (located in pysys.process.plat-unix); both modules are written to display common 
functionality in order to provide a unified abstraction where the user is not required to select the 
correct modules based on their current operation system.
