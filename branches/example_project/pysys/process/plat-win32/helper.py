	"""Windows Process wrapper for process execution and management. 
	
	The process wrapper provides the ability to start and stop an external process, setting 
	the process environment, working directory and state i.e. a foreground process in which case 
	a call to the L{start} method will not return until the process has exited, or a background 
	process in which case the process is started in a separate thread allowing concurrent execution 
	within the testcase. Processes started in the foreground can have a timeout associated with them, such
	that should the timeout be exceeded, the process will be terminated and control	passed back to the 
	caller of the method. The wrapper additionally allows control over logging of the process stdout 
	and stderr to file, and writing to the process stdin.
	
	Usage of the class is to first create an instance, setting all runtime parameters of the process 
	as data attributes to the class instance via the constructor. The process can then be started 
	and stopped via the L{start} and L{stop} methods of the class, as well as interrogated for 
	its executing status via the L{running} method, and waited for its completion via the L{wait}
	method. During process execution the C{self.pid} and C{seld.exitStatus} data attributes are set 
	within the class instance, and these values can be accessed directly via it's object reference.  

	@ivar pid: The process id for a running or complete process (as set by the OS)
	@type pid: integer
	@ivar exitStatus: The process exit status for a completed process	
	@type exitStatus: integer
