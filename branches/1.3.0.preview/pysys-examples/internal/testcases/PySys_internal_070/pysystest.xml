    <title>Custom Runner - cycleComplete() is invoked if present</title>    
    <purpose><![CDATA[
Ensures that if a custom runner class is supplied with a cycleComplete 
method, that method is invoked at the end of each cycle even when using multiple threads. 
This is to check backwards compatibility with tests created before PySys 1.3 when 
BaseRunner had an cycleComplete method that was always invoked. Use of this method is no longer 
recommended as it makes it impossible to cycle a test using multiple threads. However we retain 
the old behaviour for those that are relying on it.
