	"""
	ProcessUser provides support for safely using processes in PySys, including starting processes (with an 
	appropriate output directory), waiting for them to do what they're supposed to do, and finally ensuring all 
	processes and ports are cleaned up when each test (or the overall runner) terminates. 
	
	As the common base class of both `pysys.basetest.BaseTest` and `pysys.baserunner.BaseRunner`, ProcessUser also 
	holds shared functionality such as dynamic port allocation, copying files, creating directories etc, and 
	keeps track of the "outcome" generated by some methods (although the outcome value is only used when 
	it is subclassed by BaseTest). 

	Each ProcessUser instance is responsible for managing the lifetime of the processes started using its 
	`startProcess` method, and ensuring they are all terminated when the `cleanup` method is invoked. Additional 
	functions to be executed during cleanup can be registered using `addCleanupFunction`, for example to delete large 
	output directories, or terminate non-process resources such as docker containers or remote servers.
	
	Apart from the `addOutcome` method this class is not thread-safe, so if 
	you need to access it from multiple threads be sure to add your own locking 
	around use of its fields and methods, including any cleanup functions.

		The method allows spawning of new processes in a platform independent way. The command, arguments,

		be started in the foreground, in which case the method does not return until the process has completed
		or a time out occurs, or in the background in which case the method returns immediately to the caller
		returning a handle to the process to allow manipulation at a later stage, typically with L{waitProcess}. 
		
		All processes started in the background are automatically killed on completion of the test via the L{cleanup()} 
		destructor. To wait for background processes to complete during `execute` and/or before `verify` commences, 
		call `waitForBackgroundProcesses()`. This is especially useful when you have a test that needs to execute 
		lots of processes asynchronously, since having them all execute concurrently in the background and then calling 
		`waitForBackgroundProcesses()` will be a lot quicker than executing them serially in the foreground. 

		When starting a process that will listen on a server socket, use `getNextAvailableTCPPort` 
		to allocate a free port before calling this method. 

		.. versionchanged:: 1.6.0
			Added onError parameter and default behaviour of logging stderr/out when there's a failure.
			Added info parameter. 

		:param str command: The path to the executable to be launched (should include the full path)
		:param list[str] arguments: A list of arguments to pass to the command
		
		:param dict(str,str) environs: A dictionary specifying the environment to run the process in. 
			If a None or empty dictionary is passed, L{getDefaultEnvirons} will be invoked to 
			produce a suitable clean default environment for this `command`, containing a minimal set of variables. 
			If you wish to specify a customized environment, L{createEnvirons()} is a great way to create it.
		
		:param str workingDir: The working directory for the process to run in (defaults to the testcase output subdirectory)
		
		:param bool background: Set to True to start the process in the background. By default processes are started 
			in the foreground, meaning execution of the test will continue only once the process has terminated. 
		:param state: Alternative way to set ``background=True``. 
			Run the process either in the C{FOREGROUND} or C{BACKGROUND} (defaults to C{FOREGROUND}). Setting 
			state=BACKGROUND is equivalent to setting background=True; in new tests using background=True is the 
			preferred way to do this. 
		
		:param int timeout: The number of seconds after which to terminate processes running in the foreground. For processes 
			that complete in a few seconds or less, it is best to avoid overriding this and stick with the default. 
			However for long-running foreground processes it will be necessary to set a larger number, for example 
			if running a soak test where the process needs to run for up to 2 hours you could set ``timeout=2*60*60``. 
		
		:param str stdouterr: The filename prefix to use for the stdout and stderr of the process 
			(`.out`/`.err` will be appended), or a tuple of (stdout,stderr) as returned from 
			L{allocateUniqueStdOutErr}. 
			The stdouterr prefix is also used to form a default display name for the process if none is explicitly provided. 
			The files are created relative to the test output directory. 
			The filenames can be accessed from the returned process object using ``.stdout/err`` from 
			`pysys.process.Process`.
		
		:param str stdout: The filename used to capture the stdout of the process. It is usually simpler to use `stdouterr` instead of this. 
		:param str stderr: The filename used to capture the stderr of the process. It is usually simpler to use `stdouterr` instead of this. 
		
		:param str displayName: Logical name of the process used for display in log messages, and the str(...) 
			representation of the returned process object 
			(defaults to a string generated from the stdouterr and/or the command).
		
		:param bool abortOnError: If true abort the test on any error outcome (defaults to the defaultAbortOnError
			project setting)

		:param str expectedExitStatus: The condition string used to determine whether the exit status/code 
			returned by the process is correct. The default is '==0', as an exit code of zero usually indicates success, but if you 
			are expecting a non-zero exit status (for example because you are testing correct handling of 
			a failure condition) this could be set to '!=0' or a specific value such as '==5'. 
	
		:param bool ignoreExitStatus: If False, a BLOCKED outcome is added if the process terminates with an 
			exit code that doesn't match expectedExitStatus (or if the command cannot be run at all). 
			This can be set to True in cases where you do not care whether the command succeeds or fails, or wish to handle the 
			exit status separately with more complicated logic. 
			
			The default value of ignoreExitStatus=None means the value will 
			be taken from the project property defaultIgnoreExitStatus, which can be configured in the project XML 
			(the recommended default property value is defaultIgnoreExitStatus=False), or is set to True for 
			compatibility with older PySys releases if no project property is set. 
		
		:param Callable[pysys.process.Process]->str onError: A function that will be called 
			if the process times out or returns an unexpected exit status (unless ignoreExitStatus=True), before 
			any abort exception is raised. This provides a convenient place to add logging of 
			diagnostic information (perhaps using the stdout/err of the process) and/or extracting and returning an 
			error message from the output, for example: ``onError=lambda process: self.logFileContents(process.stderr, tail=True) or self.logFileContents(process.stdout, tail=True)``.

			If a string value is returned from it will be added to the failure reason, e.g. ``onError=lambda process: self.logFileContents(process.stderr, tail=True) and self.getExprFromFile(process.stderr, 'Error: (.*)')``.
			
			If no onError function is specified, the default is to log the last few lines of stderr (or if empty, stdout) 
			when a process fails and abortOnError=True. 
			
			The ``self.logFileContentsDefaultExcludes`` variable can be used to add regular expressions to exclude 
			unimportant lines of output such as standard startup lines (see `logFileContents`). 
		
		:param bool quiet: If True, this method will not do any INFO or WARN level logging 
			(only DEBUG level), unless a failure outcome is appended. This parameter can be 
			useful to avoid filling up the log where it is necessary to repeatedly execute a 
			command check for completion of some operation until it succeeds; in such cases 
			you should usually set ignoreExitStatus=True as well since both success and 
			failure exit statuses are valid. 
		
		:param dict[str,obj] info: A dictionary of user-defined information about this process that will be set as 
			a field on the returned Process instance. This is useful for keeping track of things like server port 
			numbers and log file paths.

		Create a new dictionary of environment variables, suitable for passing to

		This environment contains a minimal PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH but does not 
		attempt to replicate the full set of default environment variables 
		on each OS, and in particular it does not include any that identify 
		the the current username or home area. Additional environment 
		variables can be added as needed with L{createEnvirons} overrides. If 
		you don't care about minimizing the risk of your local environment 
		affecting the test processes you start, just use C{environs=os.environ} 
		to allow child processes to inherit the entire parent environment. 
		
		The L{createEnvirons()} and L{startProcess()} methods use this as the 
		basis for creating a new set of default environment variables. 

		If needed this method can be overridden in subclasses to add common 
		environment variables for every process invoked by startProcess, for 
		example to enable options such as code coverage for Java/Python/etc. 
		This is also a good place to customize behaviour for different 
		operating systems. 

		Some features of this method can be configured by setting project 
		properties:
		
		  - ``defaultEnvirons.ENV_KEY``: if any properties with this prefix are 
		    defined, an environment variable with the ENV_KEY is set by this method 
		    (unless the property value is empty). For example, to set a default 
		    JVM heap size for all processes with the ``JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`` environment 
		    variable you could set ``defaultEnvirons.JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS = -Xmx512M``. 
		
		  - ``defaultEnvironsDefaultLang``: if set to a value such as ``en_US.UTF-8`` 
		    the specified value is set for the LANG= variable on Unix; otherwise, 
		    the LANG variable is not set (which might result in use of the 
		    legacy POSIX/C encoding).
		  
		  - ``defaultEnvironsTempDir``: if set the expression will be passed to 
		    Python ``eval()`` and used to set the OS-specific temp directory 
		    environment variables. A typical value is `self.output`.
		
		  - ``defaultEnvironsLegacyMode``: set to true to enable compatibility 
		    mode which keeps the behaviour the same as PySys v1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, 
		    namely using a completely empty default environment on Unix, and 
		    a copy of the entire parent environment on Windows. This is not

		"""Wait for a regular expression line to be seen (one or more times) in a text file in the output 
		directory (waitForGrep was formerly known as `waitForSignal`).
		
		This method provides some parameters that give helpful fail-fast behaviour with a descriptive outcome reason; 
		use these whenever possible:
		
		  - ``process=`` to abort if success becomes impossible due to premature termination of the process that's 
		    generating the output
		  - ``errorExpr=`` to abort if an error message/expression is written to the file being grepped
		  - ``errorIf=`` to abort if the specified lambda function returns an error string (which can be used if the 
		    error messages go to a different file than that being grepped
		
		This will generate much clearer outcome reasons, which makes test failures easy to triage, 
		and also avoids wasting time waiting for something that will never happen.
		
		Example::
		
			self.waitForGrep('myprocess.log', expr='INFO .*Started successfully', encoding='utf-8',
				process=myprocess, errorExpr=[' (ERROR|FATAL) ', 'Failed to start'])
			
			self.waitForGrep('myoutput.txt', expr='My message', encoding='utf-8',
				process=myprocess, errorIf=lambda: self.getExprFromFile('myprocess.log', ' ERROR .*', returnNoneIfMissing=True))
			
		Note that waitForGrep fails the test if the expression is not found (unless abortOnError was set to False, 
		which isn't recommended), so there is no need to add duplication with an 
		`assertGrep <pysys.basetest.BaseTest.assertGrep>` to check for the same expression in your validation logic. 

		You can extract information from the matched expression, optionally perform assertions on it, by 
		using one or more ``(?P<groupName>...)`` named groups in the expression. A common 
		pattern is to unpack the resulting dict using ``**kwargs`` syntax and pass to `BaseTest.assertThat`. For 
		example::

			self.assertThat('username == expected', expected='myuser',
				**self.waitForGrep('myserver.log', expr=r'Successfully authenticated user "(?P<username>[^"]*)"'))

		.. versionadded:: 1.5.1

		:param str file: The path of the file to be searched. Usually this is a name/path relative to the 
			``self.output`` directory, but alternatively an absolute path can be specified. 
		
		:param str expr: The regular expression to search for in the text file.
		
		:param str condition: The condition to be met for the number of lines matching the regular expression; by default 
			we wait until there is at least one occurrence. 
		
		:param int timeout: The number of seconds to wait for the regular expression before giving up and aborting 
			the test with `pysys.constants.TIMEDOUT` (unless abortOnError=False in which case execution will continue).
		
		:param pysys.process.Process process: The process that is generating the specified 
			file, to allow the wait to fail fast (instead of timing out) if the process dies before the expected signal 
			appears. Can be None if the process is not known or is expected to terminate itself during this period. 
		
		:param list[str] errorExpr: Optional list of regular expressions, which if found in the file will cause waiting 
			for the main expression to be aborted with a `pysys.constants.BLOCKED` outcome. This is useful to avoid waiting 
			a long time for the expected expression when an ERROR is logged that means it will never happen, and 
			also provides much clearer test failure messages in this case. 

		:param callable->str errorIf: A zero-arg function that returns False/None when there is no error, or a non-empty 
			string if an error is detected which should cause us to abort looking for the grep expression. 
			This function will be executed frequently (every ``poll`` seconds) so avoid 
			doing anything time-consuming here unless you set a large polling interval. 
			
			Added in PySys 1.6.0. 

		:param list[str] ignores: A list of regular expressions used to identify lines in the files which should be ignored 
			when matching both `expr` and `errorExpr`. 

		:param List[callable[str]->str] mappers: A list of filter functions that will be used to pre-process each 
			line from the file (returning None if the line is to be filtered out). This provides a very powerful 
			capability for filtering the file, for example `pysys.mappers.IncludeLinesBetween` 
			provides the ability to filter in/out sections of a file. 
			
			Do not share mapper instances across multiple tests or threads as this can cause race conditions. 
			
			Added in PySys 1.6.0.

		:param float poll: The time in seconds between to poll the file looking for the regular expression and to check against the condition
				
		:param bool abortOnError: If True abort the test on any error outcome (defaults to the defaultAbortOnError
			project setting, which for a modern project will be True).
		
		:param str encoding: The encoding to use to open the file and convert from bytes to characters. 
			The default value is None which indicates that the decision will be delegated 
			to the L{getDefaultFileEncoding()} method. 

		:param str detailMessage: An extra string to add to the message logged when waiting to provide extra 
			information about the wait condition. e.g. ``detailMessage='(downstream message received)'``. 
			Added in v1.5.1. 

		:param int reFlags: Zero or more flags controlling how the behaviour of regular expression matching, 
			combined together using the ``|`` operator, for example ``reFlags=re.VERBOSE | re.IGNORECASE``. 
			
			For details see the ``re`` module in the Python standard library. Note that ``re.MULTILINE`` cannot 
			be used because expressions are matched against one line at a time. Added in PySys 1.5.1. 
			
		:param str filedir: Can be used to provide a directory name to add to the beginning of the ``file`` parameter; 
			however usually it is clearer just to specify that directory in the ``file``.

		:return list[re.Match]: Usually this returns a list of ``re.Match`` objects found for the ``expr``, or an 
			empty list if there was no match.
		
			If the expr contains any ``(?P<groupName>...)`` named groups, and assuming the condition is still the 
			default of ">=1" (i.e. not trying to find multiple matches), then instead of a list, a dict is returned 
			containing ``dict(groupName: str, matchValue: str or None)`` (or an empty ``{}`` dict if there is no match) 
			which allows the result to be passed to `assertThat` for further checking of the matched groups (typically 
			unpacked using the ``**`` operator; see example above).

		"""Copy a directory or a single text or binary file, optionally tranforming the contents by filtering each line through a list of mapping functions. 
		
		If any mappers are provided, the file is copied in text mode and 
		each mapper is given the chance to modify or omit each line. 
		If no mappers are provided, the file is copied in binary mode. 

		For example::
		
			self.copy('output-raw.txt', 'output-processed.txt', encoding='utf-8', 
				mappers=[
					lambda line: None if ('Timestamp: ' in line) else line, 
					lambda line: line.replace('foo', 'bar'), 
					pysys.mappers.IncludeLinesBetween('Error message .*:', stopBefore='^$'),
					pysys.mappers.RegexReplace(pysys.mappers.RegexReplace.DATETIME_REGEX, '<timestamp>'),
				])

		In addition to the file contents the attributes such as modification time and 
		executable permission will be copied where possible. 
		
		This function is useful for creating a modified version of an 
		output file that's more suitable for later validation steps such as 
		diff-ing, and also for copying required files from the input to the 
		output directory. 
		
		It can also be used for copying a whole directory, 
		similar to ``shutil.copytree`` but with the advantages of support 
		for long paths on Windows, better error safety, and that relative paths 
		are evaluated relative to the self.output directory (which is both convenient, and 
		safer than shutil's evaluation relative to the current working 
		directory). 

		For example::
		
			self.copy('src.txt', 'dest.txt')  # copies to outputdir/dest.txt
			self.copy('src.txt', self.output) # copies to outputdir/src.txt, since self.output is an existing directory
			self.copy('src.txt', 'foo/')      # copies to outputdir/foo/src.txt since destination ends with a slash
			self.copy('srcdirname', 'foo/')   # copies to outputdir/foo/srcdirname since destination ends with a slash

		Usually custom mappers are simple functions or lambdas, however for advanced use cases you can 
		additionally provide ``mapper.fileStarted([self,] srcPath, destPath, srcFile, destFile)`` and/or  
		``mapper.fileFinished(...)`` methods to allow stateful operations, or to perform extra read/write operations 
		before lines are read/written. For example::
		
			class CustomLineMapper(object):
				def fileStarted(self, srcPath, destPath, srcFile, destFile):
					self.src = os.path.basename(srcPath)
				
				def __call__(self, line):
					return '"'+self.src+'": '+line
				
				def fileFinished(self, srcPath, destPath, srcFile, destFile):
					destFile.write('\\n' + 'footer added by CustomLineMapper')
			self.copy('src.txt', 'dest.txt', mappers=[CustomLineMapper()])

		.. versionchanged:: 1.6.0
			Ability to copy directories was added, along with the ``overwrite=``, ``symlinks=``, 
			``ignoreIf=`` and ``skipMappersIf=`` arguments. 

		:param str src: The source filename or directory, which can be an absolute path, or 
			a path relative to the ``self.output`` directory. 
			Use ``src=self.input+'/myfile'`` if you wish to copy a file from the test 
			input directory. 
		
		:param str dest: The destination file or directory name, which can be an absolute path, or 
			a path relative to the `self.output` directory. Destination file(s) are overwritten if the 
			dest already exists. 
			
			The dest and src can be the same for file copies (but not directory copies). 
			
			As a convenience to avoid repeating the same text in the src and destination, 
			if the dest ends with a slash, or the src is a file and the dest is an existing directory, 
			the dest is taken as a parent directory into which the src will be copied in retaining its current name. 
		
		:param bool overwrite: If True, source files will be allowed to 
			overwrite destination files, if False an exception will be raised if a destination file already exists. 
			By default overwrite=None which means it's enabled for single file copy() but disabled for directory copies.
		
		:param List[callable[str]->str] mappers: A list of filter functions that will be applied, 
			in order, to map each line from source to destination. Each function accepts a string for 
			the current line as input and returns either a string to write or 
			None if the line is to be omitted. Any ``None`` items in the mappers list will be ignored. 
			
			See `pysys.mappers` for some useful predefined mappers such as `pysys.mappers.IncludeLinesBetween` 
			and `pysys.mappers.RegexReplace`. 
			
			If present the ``mapper.fileStarted(...)`` and/or ``mapper.fileFinished(...)`` methods will be called on each 
			mapper in the list at the start and end of each file; see above for an example. 
			
			Do not share mapper instances across multiple tests or threads as this can cause race conditions. 
			
		:param str encoding: The encoding to use to open the file (only used if mappers are provided; if not, it is 
			opened in binary mode). 
			The default value is None which indicates that the decision will be delegated 
			to the L{getDefaultFileEncoding()} method. 
		
		:param bool symlinks: Set to True if symbolic links in the source tree should be represented as symbolic 
			links in the destination (rather than just being copied). 
		
		:param callable[str]->bool ignoreIf: A callable that accepts a source path and returns True if 
			this file/directory should be omitted from a directory copy. 
			For example: ``ignoreIf=lambda src: src.endswith(('.tmp', '.log')))``

		:param callable[str]->bool skipMappersIf: A callable that accepts a source path and returns True if 
			this file should be copied in binary mode (as if no mappers had been specified). 
			For example: ``skipMappersIf=lambda src: not src.endswith(('.xml', '.properties')))``
