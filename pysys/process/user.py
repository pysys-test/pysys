	The ProcessUser class provides the minimum set of operations for managing and interacting with
	processes. The class is designed to be extended by the L{pysys.baserunner.BaseRunner} and 
	L{pysys.basetest.BaseTest} classes so that they prescribe a common set of process operations 
	that any child test can use. Process operations have associated potential outcomes in their
	execution, e.g. C{BLOCKED}, C{TIMEDOUT}, C{DUMPEDCORE} etc. As such the class additionally acts
	as the container for storing the list of outcomes from all child test related actions.
	
	Apart from the C{addOutcome} method this class is not thread-safe, so if 
	you need to access it from multiple threads be sure to add your own locking 
	around use of its fields and methods, including any cleanup functions.

		Create a new dictionary of environment variables, suitable for passing to 
		L{startProcess()}, with a minimal clean set of environment variables 
		for this platform, unaffected (as much as possible) by the 
		environment that the tests are being run under. 
		
		This environment contains a minimal PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH but does not 
		attempt to replicate the full set of default environment variables 
		on each OS, and in particular it does not include any that identify 
		the the current username or home area. Additional environment 
		variables can be added as needed with L{createEnvirons} overrides. If 
		you don't care about minimizing the risk of your local environment 
		affecting the test processes you start, just use C{environs=os.environ} 
		to allow child processes to inherit the entire parent environment. 
		
		The L{createEnvirons()} and L{startProcess()} methods use this as the 
		basis for creating a new set of default environment variables. 

		If needed this method can be overridden in subclasses to add common 
		environment variables for every process invoked by startProcess, for 
		example to enable options such as code coverage for Java/Python/etc. 
		This is also a good place to customize behaviour for different 
		operating systems. 

		Some features of this method can be configured by setting project 
		properties:
		
		  - `defaultEnvironsDefaultLang`: if set to a value such as `en_US.UTF-8` 
		    the specified value is set for the LANG= variable on Unix; otherwise, 
		    the LANG variable is not set (which might result in use of the 
		    legacy POSIX/C encoding).
		  
		  - `defaultEnvironsTempDir`: if set the expression will be passed to 
		    Python `eval()` and used to set the OS-specific temp directory 
		    environment variables. A typical value is `self.output`.
		
		  - `defaultEnvironsLegacyMode`: set to true to enable compatibility 
		    mode which keeps the behaviour the same as PySys v1.1, 1.2 and 1.3, 
		    namely using a completely empty default environment on Unix, and 
		    a copy of the entire parent environment on Windows. This is not 
		    recommended unless you have a lot of legacy tests that cannot 
		    easily be changed to only set minimal required environment 
		    variables using `createEnvirons()`. 

		@param command: If known, the full path of the executable for which 
		a default environment is being created (when called from `startProcess` 
		this is always set). This allows default environment variables to be 
		customized for different process types e.g. Java, Python, etc.
