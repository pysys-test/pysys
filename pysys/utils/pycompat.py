	Opens the specified file, following the default 
	"open()" semantics for this Python version unless an encoding is 
	explicitly specified, in which case a file stream 
	yielding (unicode) character strings is always returned. 
	
	Specifically:
	
	On Python 3 this method returns a file stream yielding character strings 
	unless a binary mode was specified in which case a stream yielding 
	bytes is returned. 
	
	On Python 2 this method returns a file stream yielding unicode 
	character strings only if an encoding was explicitly specified; 
	otherwise it returns a file stream yielding "str" bytes objects. 
	
	@param path: The path to open; must be an absolute path. 
	Even on Windows this path can be long (e.g. more than the usual 256 
	character Windows limit). 
	
	@param mode: The file mode, e.g. 'r' for reading, 'wb' for binary writing. 
	
	@param encoding: The encoding to use to translate between the bytes of the 
	file and the characters used in the returned stream. If an encoding 
	is specified then the returned stream is always a unicode character stream. 
	This must be None if the mode specifies binary. 
	
	@param errors: Optional string that specifies how encoding/decoding errors 
	are handled, such as 'strict', 'ignore', 'replace'; see documentation of 
	io module for more details. The value of this attribute is ignored 
	if using the python 2 open() built-in with bytes mode that does not support it. 
	
	@param kwargs: Any additional args to be passed to open() or io.open(). 
	
	@return: A file stream, either using unicode characters or binary bytes. 
	This stream should be closed when no longer required.
