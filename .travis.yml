# Travis CI configuration file. 
#
# Executes Unix shell commands instructions from "install", then "script" sections, then finally invokes "deploy" if successful. 
#
# If you wish to try something out manually any of these commands will run just as well in a Linux shell. 
# However for ease of use and build reproducability execution on Travis is the canonical way to build PySys 
# binary (whl) and source distributions, as well as packages of the API doc and samples. 
#
# Only required setup in Travis is to set the secure environment variable GITHUB_API_KEY to 
# a personal access token from this GitHub repo (to be found under Developer Settings)
